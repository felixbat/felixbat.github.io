Background
------
After receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany, I went on to pursue a consecutive Master of Science in automotive engineering from KIT. Additionally, I hold a Master of Engineering degree from Tongji University in Shanghai, China, where I spent two years. I concluded my M.Sc. studies with a research project at Bosch (China) Investment Ltd., leading to the dissertation “Modelling and Degree of Hybridization Optimization of a Fuel Cell-Battery Hybrid Scooter”.
