* Autonomous Vehicles will need to stay safe in any possible scenario
* Traditional validation methods are not equipped to deal with this complexity
* Especially critical corner case scenarios are of interest to prove the safety of Autonomous Vehicles
* Machine Learning can help to identify these corner case scenarios from the vast amount of possible scenarios
