Abstract: Safety is an essential aspect in the facilitation of automated vehicle deployment. Current testing practices are not enough, and going beyond them leads to infeasible testing requirements, such as needing to drive billions of kilometres on public roads. Automated vehicles are exposed to an indeﬁnite number of scenarios. Handling of the most challenging scenarios should be tested, which leads to the question of how such corner cases can be determined. We propose an approach to identify the performance boundary, where these corner cases are located, using Gaussian Process Classiﬁcation. We also demonstrate the classiﬁcation on an exemplary trafﬁc jam approach scenario, showing that it is feasible and would lead to more efﬁcient testing practices.
